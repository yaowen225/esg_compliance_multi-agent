\section{Introduction}

The increasing complexity of regulatory compliance across various industries has created an urgent need for intelligent automation solutions. Traditional compliance checking processes rely heavily on manual review, expert analysis, and rule-based systems, which are often time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. The emergence of Agentic AI—artificial intelligence systems where autonomous agents collaborate to solve complex problems—presents a transformative opportunity for automating compliance verification tasks.

Compliance checking involves understanding regulatory standards, analyzing organizational reports against these standards, identifying gaps or violations, and generating actionable recommendations. This multi-faceted process requires sophisticated reasoning capabilities, domain expertise, and the ability to handle various document formats and structures. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent frameworks have made it possible to develop intelligent systems that can perform these complex analytical tasks.

In this paper, we present a novel Agentic AI framework specifically designed for automated compliance checking. Our system demonstrates its capabilities through Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting standards, using the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) framework as a concrete implementation example. However, the architecture is designed with extensibility in mind, enabling application to diverse compliance domains including financial regulations, quality standards, and industry-specific requirements.

The key contributions of this work include:
\begin{itemize}
\item A multi-agent architecture that leverages specialized AI agents for different aspects of compliance analysis
\item A comprehensive document processing pipeline that handles multi-modal content including PDFs, images, and structured text
\item A semantic retrieval system that enables intelligent matching between compliance standards and organizational reports
\item A practical demonstration of Agentic AI applied to real-world compliance scenarios
\item An extensible framework design that can be adapted to various regulatory domains
\end{itemize}

Our approach represents a significant step forward in applying collaborative AI systems to regulatory compliance challenges, offering the potential to dramatically improve efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of compliance verification processes.
